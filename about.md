I am **Syafiq Hadzir**, a Software Engineer in Test (SDET) with 12 years of
experience in breaking software so you don’t have to.

I started my career when "testing" meant clicking the same button fifty times
and praying the server wouldn't catch fire. Today, I architect automated quality
systems that predict bugs before a developer even hits `git push`.

I believe that **Quality Assurance is Engineering**. The days of manual testers
being treated as second-class citizens who failed at coding are over. If you
cannot read the code you are testing, you are essentially a building inspector
who doesn’t know what a brick looks like.

## What I Write About

This blog is my digital garden (and occasional rant space) for exploring the
bleeding edge of software quality. You won’t find tutorials on "How to write a
test case in Excel" here. Instead, I cover:

- **Future Tech**: How do we test Quantum Cryptography? What is the QA strategy
  for 6G networks or the Metaverse?
- **Chaos Engineering**: Because if you don’t break your production environment
  on purpose, a squirrel chewing through a fibre optic cable eventually will.
- **Ethical AI**: Moving beyond "Does it work?" to "Should we have built this?"
  and "Why is this algorithm racist?"
- **Performance & Security**: From identifying memory leaks in Node.js to
  auditing smart contracts in Web3.

## My Philosophy

I follow a simple rule: **If you do it twice, automate it.** If you do it once,
automate it anyway for the portfolio.

I have spent a decade debugging pipelines, fighting with flaky Cypress tests,
and mourning the death of Internet Explorer (good riddance). I’ve learned that
tools change every eighteen months, but the mindset of curiosity is timeless.

## Join the Mission

We are moving from an era of **Verification** (Did we build it right?) to
**Validation** (Did we build the right thing?) to **Ethics** (Is this thing safe
for humanity?).

If you enjoy deep dives into technical strategy, cynical takes on "industry best
practices," and the occasional joke about `node_modules` being heavier than a
black hole, you’re in the right place.
