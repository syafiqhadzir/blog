## Introduction

Welcome to **{{ site.title }}**. I value your privacy and am committed to
protecting your personal data. This privacy policy will inform you about how I
look after your personal data when you visit my website and tell you about your
privacy rights and how the law protects you.

## Information I Collect

This website is a static blog. I do not have a user registration system, and I
do not collect "Personal Data" in the traditional sense (like names or
addresses) unless you explicitly provide it to me (e.g., via email).

However, I use third-party services that may collect data:

- **Google Analytics (GA4)**: I use GA4 to understand how visitors interact with
  the site. This service uses cookies to track information such as your IP
  address, browser type, and pages visited. This data is anonymized and used
  solely for performance analysis.
- **AMP Components**: Some AMP components (like `amp-youtube`, `amp-twitter`)
  may collect data as part of their functionality.

## How Your Data is Used

The data collected is used to:

- Monitor and analyze web traffic.
- Improve the user experience and site performance.
- Ensure the security of the website.

## Your Privacy Rights

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in
relation to your personal data, including the right to:

- Request access to your personal data.
- Request correction of your personal data.
- Request erasure of your personal data.
- Object to processing of your personal data.
- Request restriction of processing your personal data.
- Request transfer of your personal data.
- Right to withdraw consent.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact me at
**{{ site.email }}**.

## Third-Party Links

This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, and
applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow
third parties to collect or share data about you. I do not control these
third-party websites and am not responsible for their privacy statements.
