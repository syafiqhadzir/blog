## Introduction

In 4G, we streamed video. In 5G, we connected smart cities. In 6G, the network
_is_ the computer.

With terabit speeds and microsecond latency, the concept of "downloading" will
disappear. Data will stream faster than your hard drive can write it. Your
storage becomes the bottleneck, which is a sentence I never thought I would
type.

**QA Challenge**: How do you test an app that assumes infinite bandwidth? The
same way you test anything—by assuming everything will break, and then proving
yourself right.

## TL;DR

- **Loading spinners become extinct**: If your app shows a loading spinner for
  more than ten milliseconds, something is broken.
- **Holographic interfaces arrive**: The web is moving from 2D screens to 3D
  volumetric displays. CSS Grid is about to get very interesting.
- **Battery drain accelerates**: 6G radios are power hungry. If your app keeps
  the radio active, the phone melts.

## Terahertz Waves and Micro-Latencies

6G operates in the terahertz spectrum. Great speed, terrible range. A sheet of
paper blocks the signal. A pigeon flying past causes a dropout. The physics is
beautiful; the engineering is a nightmare.

**QA Strategy**: Test "Handover Storms". Walk down the street. Your phone
switches towers every ten metres. Does the WebSocket connection survive a
hundred handovers per minute? If not, your real-time collaborative document
editor becomes a real-time collaborative disaster.

## Network Slicing Verification

Carriers will offer "Slices"—dedicated channels optimised for specific uses:

- Slice A: Gamer Mode (Low Latency).
- Slice B: Video Mode (High Bandwidth).
- Slice C: IoT Mode (Low Power).

Your app must negotiate the correct slice. If your pacemaker gets the "Gamer
Mode" slice, that is fine. If your self- driving car gets the "IoT Mode" slice
(high latency), people die. The stakes are not academic.

## Code Snippet: 6G Latency Simulator

You cannot buy a 6G modem yet. But you can simulate the instability of terahertz
physics.

```javascript
/*
  6g-simulator.js
*/

class NetworkConnection {
  constructor() {
    this.latency = 0.1; // 100 microseconds
    this.packetLoss = 0.0;
    this.handoverCount = 0;
  }

  // Simulate walking behind a tree
  blockSignal() {
    console.log('🌳 Line of Sight Lost');
    this.packetLoss = 1.0; // 100% loss immediately
  }

  // Simulate switching dynamic network slices
  switchSlice(type) {
    this.handoverCount++;
    console.log(`⚡ Handover #${this.handoverCount} to Slice: ${type}`);

    switch (type) {
      case 'URLLC': // Ultra Reliable Low Latency
        this.latency = 0.05;
        break;
      case 'mMTC': // Massive Machine Type (IoT)
        this.latency = 50.0;
        break;
    }
  }
}

const connection = new NetworkConnection();
// Simulation Run
setInterval(() => {
  // Random handover every 200ms
  if (Math.random() > 0.8) connection.switchSlice('URLLC');
  if (Math.random() > 0.9) connection.blockSignal();
}, 200);
```

## Summary

The "Loading Bar" will join the "Save Icon" (floppy disk) in the museum of
obsolete UI metaphors. But the complexity merely shifts from the client to the
edge.

QA must test the **edge**, not just the server. Your code does not run in a data
centre any more. It runs on the cell tower five hundred metres away, and that
tower has opinions about your implementation.

## Key Takeaways

- **Edge compute changes everything**: Your code runs on the cell tower nearby,
  not in AWS `us-east-1`. Latency profiles are different; test accordingly.
- **Precise positioning creates privacy risks**: 6G knows your location to the
  centimetre. Privacy tests are critical.
- **Digital twins precede deployment**: We will test on a digital twin of the
  city before deploying to the real city.

## Next Steps

- **Read**: _6G: The Next Horizon_ (Whitepaper).
- **Learn**: **Edge Computing Patterns** (Cloudflare Workers / AWS Lambda@Edge).
- **Tool**: **NS-3 Network Simulator**.
